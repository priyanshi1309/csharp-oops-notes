# OOP Basics in C#

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** organizes software design around **objects**, which contain:
- **Data**: Fields & Properties
- **Behavior**: Methods

---

## 1. Class and Object
- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class.

---

## 2. Properties and Fields
- **Field**: Variable inside a class storing data.
- **Property**: Controlled access to fields (`get` / `set`).

---

## 3. Methods
- A block of code inside a class that performs specific tasks.

---

## 4. Constructor
- Special method to initialize new objects.
- Has the same name as the class, no return type.

---

## 5. Access Modifiers
Control how members are accessed:
- `public`: Accessible anywhere.
- `private`: Accessible only inside the class.
- `protected`: Inside the class + derived classes.
- `internal`: Within the same assembly.
- `protected internal`: Same assembly or derived classes.

---

## 6. Static Members
- Belong to the class, not a specific object.
- Shared across all instances.
