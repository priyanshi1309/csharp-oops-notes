# Beginner OOP Interview Questions

This file contains common beginner-level Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) interview questions along with brief explanations to help you prepare.

---

## 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which contain data and methods to operate on that data.

---

## 2. What are the four main pillars of OOP?

- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting access to some components.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving new classes from existing classes to promote code reuse.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take many forms, mainly through method overriding and overloading.

---

## 3. What is a class and an object?

- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class containing actual data.

---

## 4. What is a constructor?

A special method that initializes a new object when it is created.

---

## 5. What is method overloading?

Having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class.

---

## 6. What is method overriding?

A derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.

---

## 7. What are access modifiers?

Keywords that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. Examples include:

- `public` — accessible everywhere
- `private` — accessible only within the class
- `protected` — accessible within the class and its subclasses

---

## 8. What is the difference between `class` and `struct` in C#?

- Classes are reference types and stored on the heap.
- Structs are value types and stored on the stack.

---

## 9. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class?

- **Interface**: Only method declarations, no implementation.
- **Abstract class**: Can have both declarations and implementations.

---

## 10. Why use encapsulation?

To protect object integrity by preventing outside code from directly accessing or modifying data.

---

## 11. What is the difference between composition and inheritance?

- **Inheritance**: “Is-a” relationship (e.g., Dog is a Animal).
- **Composition**: “Has-a” relationship (e.g., Car has an Engine).

---

## 12. What is a static member?

A member (variable or method) shared across all instances of a class.

---

## 13. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword?

Refers to the current instance of the class.

---

## 14. What is a property in C#?

A member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute private fields.
